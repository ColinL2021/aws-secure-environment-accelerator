Cost
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used in deploying this solution. The costs for the ASEA depend on the underlying architecture that is provisioned based on the customizable configuration. 

Sample Config Summary Costs
Table 1 describes the estimated monthly cost based on the sample configurations provided. Any changes to the configuration file will impact the costs. The costs are based on a month with 31 days (744 hours), On-Demand Instances pricing and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for 3rd party firewalls. These are estimated costs, as the solution is continuously updated and is dependent on the configuration used to implement the solution. These estimates do not include any customer workloads. Any workloads implemented would have to be independently costed. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this solution. 

As shown below, different config files dramatically change the monthly cost of running the solution from $30/month, to $1500/month, to $2400/month, to over $3700/month. The price of the deployed solution is 100% dependent on what the customer deploys, and not on the Accelerator automation engine itself. 

Most of the example config files (except ultra-lite) build a highly available and scalable multi-datacenter environment with hyperscale routing and enterprise grade security worldwide, something that would cost tens of millions of dollars on-premises and still not achieve the same results.

Pricing represents reasonably steady state, minimal activity or traffic flows in the accounts and includes sample workload accounts when they exist in the example configs. The current sample deployment(s) are a little expensive when used solely for testing in a personal account, yet typically only represent a very small percentage of a production customers AWS spend.
