Cost
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used in deploying this solution. The costs for the ASEA depend on the underlying architecture that is provisioned based on the customizable configuration. 

Sample Config Summary Costs
Table 1 describes the estimated monthly cost based on the sample configurations provided. Any changes to the configuration file will impact the costs. The costs are based on a month with 31 days (744 hours), On-Demand Instances pricing and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for 3rd party firewalls. These are estimated costs, as the solution is continuously updated and is dependent on the configuration used to implement the solution. These estimates do not include any customer workloads. Any workloads implemented would have to be independently costed. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this solution. 

As shown below, different config files dramatically change the monthly cost of running the solution from $30/month, to $1500/month, to $2400/month, to over $3700/month. The price of the deployed solution is 100% dependent on what the customer deploys, and not on the Accelerator automation engine itself. 

Most of the example config files (except ultra-lite) build a highly available and scalable multi-datacenter environment with hyperscale routing and enterprise grade security worldwide, something that would cost tens of millions of dollars on-premises and still not achieve the same results.

Pricing represents reasonably steady state, minimal activity or traffic flows in the accounts and includes sample workload accounts when they exist in the example configs. The current sample deployment(s) are a little expensive when used solely for testing in a personal account, yet typically only represent a very small percentage of a production customers AWS spend.

| Ultra-Lite Config                                      | This configuration file was created to represent an extremely minimalistic Accelerator deployment, simply to demonstrate the art of the possible for an extremely simple config. This example is NOT recommended as it violates many AWS best practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | $35                    |
| Lite Config – AWS Control Tower w/AWS Network Firewall | Recommended starting point. Same as Lite Config – AWS Network Firewall config with the addition of AWS Control Tower                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | $2,400                 |
| Lite Config – AWS Network Firewall                     | Same as Lite Config – IPSEC VPN Firewall except the use of AWS Network Firewall in place of the 3rd Party firewalls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | $2,400                 |
| Lite Config – IPSEC VPN Firewall                       | Same as Full Config – Large IPSEC VPN Firewall w/Endpoints with the following changes: 1) Reduces the FortiGate instance sizes from c5n.2xl to c5n.xl (VM08 to VM04) in VPN option. 2) Only deploys the 9 required centralized Interface Endpoints (removes 50). All services remain accessible using the AWS public endpoints, but require traversing the perimeter firewalls. 3) Removes the perimeter VPC Interface Endpoints. 4) Removes the Unclass ou and VPC | $2,500                 |
| Test Config                                            | Further reduces solution costs, while demonstrating full solution functionality (NOT recommended for production). Based on Lite Config – AWS Network Firewall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | $1,500                 |
| Full Config – Large IPSEC VPN Firewall w/Endpoints     | The full configuration file was based on feedback from customers moving into AWS at scale and at a rapid pace. Customers of this nature have indicated that they do not want to have to upsize their perimeter firewalls or add Interface endpoints as their developers start to use new AWS services. These are the two most expensive components of the deployed architecture solution.                                                                           | $3,700                 |

| Management     | Organization Management (root) account functions as the root of the AWS Organization, the billing aggregator, attachment point for SCPs. Workloads are not intended to run in this account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | $91.88                 |
| Operations     | The operations account provides a central location for the cloud team to provide cloud operation services to other AWS accounts within the Organization; for example CICD, developer tooling, and a managed Active Directory installation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | $748.83                |
| Security       | The security account is restricted to authorized security and compliance personnel, and related security or audit tools. This is an aggregation point for security services, including AWS Security Hub, and serves as the Organization Management (root) for Amazon Guard Duty. A trust relationship with a read-only permission policy exists between every Organization account and the security account for audit and compliance purposes.                                                                                    | $46.80                 |
| Log Archive    | The log archive account provides a central aggregation and secure storage point for all audit logs created within the AWS Organization. This account contains a centralized location for copies of every account’s Audit and Configuration compliance logs. It also provides a storage location for any other audit/compliance logs, as well as application/OS logs.                                                                                                                                                              | $68.72                 |
| Perimeter      | The perimeter account, and in particular the perimeter VPC therein, functions as the single point of ingress/egress from the cloud environment to the public internet and/or on-premises network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | $331.17                |
| Shared Network | The shared network account hosts the vast majority of the AWS-side of the networking resources throughout the AWS Secure Environment Architecture. Workload-scoped VPCs (Dev, Test, Prod, etc.) are defined here, and shared via RAM sharing to the respective OUs in the Organization. A Transit Gateway provides connectivity from the workloads to the internet or on-prem, without permitting cross-environment (AKA "East: West traffic") traffic (e.g. there is no Transit Gateway route from the Dev VPC to the Prod VPC). | $1,009.89              |
| MyDev1         | This is an optional sample workload account.  As this is a Dev account, it is to be used for Development. Accounts in this organizational unit host development tools and line of business application solutions that are part of approved releases and projects. These accounts have internet access via the Perimeter firewall.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | $76.52                 |
| TheFunAccount  | This is an optional sample workload account that is created in Sandbox organizational unit. Sandbox accounts used by development teams for proof of concept / prototyping work. These accounts are isolated at a network level and are not connected to the VPCs hosting development, test, and production workloads. These accounts have direct internet access via an internet gateway (IGW). They do not route through the Perimeter Security services VPC for internet access.                                                | $75.35                 |
